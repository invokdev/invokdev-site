     <br/>
     <p>
       At InvokDEV we specialize in Linux developement, we can assist you in either Linux system administration, or migrating your current Windows or MacOS setup to Linux. You can think of us as a consulting firm that can get the ball rolling for your company and get your current IT Systems team up to speed. If you aren't already familiar with it, Linux is the computer operating system that runs most of the world. It's used in practically everything and chances are most of the things you interact with on a daily basis are running some version of Linux on them. However it's not commonly used as a daily desktop environment, which leads it to be confusing and unfamiliar to most who aren't accustomed to it. That's where we come in, with years of Linux experience and most of us solely using Linux for all of our day to day activities. We'll easily be able to setup a linux system for your business and turn it into a user friendly environment for your employees to use.

       As far as the business advantages go, you'll see a noticable improvement in your computers day to day performance. Running other systems mainly Windows can be slow and inefficient for your servers overall functionality. Windows is a fairly clunky operating system that can be bloated as well as buggy, leading to slower performance and more frequent server crashes. With linux you'll have less overall bloat, and with a stable long term distrobution of linux you'll rarely run into an operating issue. Which will give your employees less headaches and more time to get done what they need to get done. As for your current IT team and System Administrators there day to day tasks, and overall maintenance of the system will be easier. All in all, it will lead to a more productive working environment for all of your employees.

     <h3>What is Linux?</h3>
     <p id="whats-linux">
       So what is Linux? Linux can be a confusing topic, and it can take hours or even days to get a correct answer as to what Linux is. In short, Linux is an operating system, but mainly it's a kernel that's used to tell the computer's hardware what to do and how to do it. The linux kernel is the most important part, as it runs the entire operating system, and makes your computer function correctly. The common comparission that's used is that the linux kernel is like the engine of a car, without it the car won't function correctly.

     <h3>What's a Distrobution?</h3>
     <p id="distro">
       A distrobution is the other piece of the operating system, that you'll interact with on a daily basis. In essence the distobution is more or less the operating system you'll be using. Each linux distrobution is different than the next, however they're all fairly similar. There are main distrobutions and then various forks of each distrobution, giving you a limitless amount of options to choose from. The distrobution will include most of the software you will use, as well as the desktop environment that you'll interact with. If we revert back to the car analogy, you can think of the distrobution as being the rest of the car that you're driving. Yes all the finishing pieces are important, however it'd still get nowhere with out the engine to drive it.

     <h3>How is Linux different than other Operating Systems</h3>
     <p id="differences">
       So how is Linux different than Windows and MacOS? Well it's a debate that's been going on for decades and most likely will continue for decades.
