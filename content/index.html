		<h1>InvokDEV: a quick intro!</h1>
		<p>Don't be fooled by the name, it's not a Web Developement Shop. I'm just a lone novice still figuring out the basics of coding.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
		It all started when I was selling insurance. I was stuck purchasing leads that were expensive and ineffective. Leaving me to make a minimum of 500 calls a day, just to get a few sales that week. I realized that in order to get leads I wanted, and to minimize the amount of effort I was putting into work, I'd have to come up with something outside-the-box to ease my troubles. I decided it was time for me to figure out how to make my own lead generation system. Which involved setting up a system that could capture leads for me, i.e a landing page. At first I found myself in what I'd assume is the most common trap people fall into, an easy to make lead funnel maker called "Click-Funnels". In essence it wasn't a bad site and it did help me figure out the inner workings of lead funnels. However it wasn't exactly what I needed nor did the costs justify using it... It can get fairly pricey, depending on how you're using it. There are a few other issues I had with it however, the point of this isn't to bash the aformentioned service.
		</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
		So after a few weeks of using the service, I found a more "homegrown" method to meet the needs I was looking for. I stumbled on a few different youtube videos that spoke on Wordpress and creating your own lead funnel system from scratch, at a fraction of the cost. Wordpress was almost exactly what I was looking for, with the almost limitless custimization options, plugins and themes you can really make it your own. However the deeper you get into Wordpress and trying to tweak everything as much as possible to get it exactly how you want it, it gets costly. On the upside though you can use custom code within wordpress which if you know what you're doing will cut some of the costs of the extra fancy stuff you can buy. Which once again lead me down another rabbit hole of "how does one code". That rabbit hole lead me to a plethora of new computer skills I didn't think were possible, nor as simple for me to figure out.

        <br/>
        <p>
		Whilst continuing my journey down the rabbit hole I stumbled upon a website called freecodecamp.org. It was perfect timing, I was in need of knowledge to aid me in my quest, and it was free so win win. It's there that I originally learned how HTML, JAVA/JSON and CSS worked, of course it wasn't an end all be all course, nor would the certificate I received get me anywhere fancy like a job at Google or Amazon. But it did set me on the right course, and give me a strong base to build on as far as front-end development is concerned. I won't bore you with how long it took, nor the sloppy projects that were wipped together in order to get the certification of completion. Yet it was the biggest step I took into the rabbit hole that's lead me down the path I'm on to this day, and has lead me on a vast amount of computer journeys. But it still leaves the question, where am I today and how can I help you?

        <br/>
        <p>
		To end this long diatribe I've gone on. I'm now able to create websites by scratch, which means I know exaclty how to use HTML, JSON and CSS to create a webpage that's viewed on the internet. Continuing my previous rant on the rabbit hole, it's also lead me to Linux and what many would consider as the proper operating system to use on computers, along with the power it gives you. Reverting back to my previous statement on the coding languages I've learned, I've been teaching myself more advanced coding languages to add functinality to the sites design. In essence between where I started, and what I've learned I'm more than confident that I can build you the ideal website that you're looking for. In a transparent and non-complicated manor, I can give you the website of your dreams to drive in more customers or create more leads for either you or your employees.
